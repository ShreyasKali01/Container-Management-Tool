# Container-Management-Tool
In this project, I have implemented GUI for basic docker commands to create, show, delete and inspect the container using Html , CSS, javascript, ajax and express
The future scope of the project is to add user authentication, Docker build, Docker registry connection, and Terminal on webpage to perform action in running containers
